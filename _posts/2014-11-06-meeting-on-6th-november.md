<span class="userContent" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">Hey all! We&#8217;re back tonight in Level 5 of the Union at 6pm tonight. Come along and game, code or chat with us.</span>

Tonight will be pretty free-form as we&#8217;re planning some bigger activities for the coming weeks and want to get your opinions on them. Chat with Rob and me to find out more and have your say.

<span class="userContent" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">Remember that we&#8217;ve got a hackathon coming up on the 6th and 7th of December, so remember to get the time booked off work to come along and join in the fun!</span>

<span class="userContent" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">Hope to see you all tonight! (Remember! BYOG)<br /> </span>

Tschüs!
