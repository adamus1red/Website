Hey there everyone!

Firstly, Happy new year!

Quick announcement for the start of this year, We will be returning to the usual structure of meetings from this Thursday (22nd) onward. This thursday (6 til 10) on lvl 5 of the union, is going to be a bit of a mash up, There are some things we would love to do to the servers (Percussive maintenence as we like to call it) but we would also love to know what you have been getting up to over the holidays.

We would also like to invite you along to GAMES on Tuesday (20th), this is the recently formed Gaming section of Geeksoc who have been running on a trial basis for the last semester. This week it has been decided that it will be a Zombie Survival Night (Games such as Killing floor, L4D2, How to survive and Warcraft3). Do come along to have some fun.

Both nights are BYOG (Bring your own gear).

See you all soon,

Geeksoc Committee
