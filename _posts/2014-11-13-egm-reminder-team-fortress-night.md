It&#8217;s EGM day! (Stay with me, there&#8217;s alcohol involved, honestly)

Tonight we need you all to come along and make sure you have your opinions voiced. We&#8217;ll vote on the future of our society and propose some major changes to the way we do things at GeekSoc. Please come along so that you can cast your vote and decide on our future!

After that, it&#8217;s Team Fortress 2 Night! Bring along a laptop and the game and compete against everyone. As an added bonus well be giving away alcoholic beverages as rewards during the event! First person to kill me (Craig) 5 times will win the drink of their choice. More rewards will materialise as the night progresses <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" />

Hope to see you all there! Remember to bring your laptop, TF2 if you can, and your opinion! We&#8217;re counting on you!

See you at six!

[Edit] As a quick social experiment, could you possibly take a second to fill out this 2 question survey on where you found out about the EGM? <span style="font-size: small;"><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/h0xlHBK2jx" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/forms/h0xlHBK2jx</a></span> Thanks!
