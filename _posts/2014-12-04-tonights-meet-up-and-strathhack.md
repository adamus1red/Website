Hey all,

Thanks to those who attended the DefCon Capture the Flag event on the 25th. It went great and we all learned lots! Hopefully we&#8217;ll be doing some more things like this in future (though with network access next time and a bit more guidance for newer people!).

Thanks also to those who attended the Gaming meet-up on Tuesday as part of our trial run of more gaming events within the society. If you need to unwind, head along to the next one on Tuesday @ 7pm.

This week we&#8217;re preparing for StrathHack and Rob needs help getting sorted. If you fancy getting your hands dirty setting up Network Relays we&#8217;d appreciate it! (As always we&#8217;ll have our LAN running too.)

If you&#8217;d like to attend StrathHack and haven&#8217;t already done so, sign up <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/strathhack-tickets-14248376277?aff=eac2" target="_blank">here</a>. Space is strictly limited so grab a spot while they&#8217;re still going!

See you guys at **6pm, Level 5**. As always, BYOG!

(P.S There&#8217;s some Demos/Open Source games <a href="http://geeksoc.org/~cmorrison/" target="_blank">on my page</a> that may be of use if you fancy getting some LAN gaming going, more will be added soon!)
