Hey everyone! Hope you all had a good time at tonight&#8217;s meet! Sorry I couldn&#8217;t be there for it!

Remember that if you&#8217;re coming to StrathHack this weekend you&#8217;ll need to reserve a space in advance on our Eventbrite page [here][1].

Free food and drink are provided and there&#8217;s prizes up for grabs too over the Saturday & Sunday (This weekend!). Doors open at 10am Saturday and we&#8217;re running through the night till Sunday afternoon at 5pm when everything wraps up.

Come along and join the fun! Hope to see you there!
