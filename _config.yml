#### Under the Hood Stuff #####

# Use rdiscount as the markdown engine because it generates html5 compliant code for stuff like footnotes
# If you use maroku (default engine) some of your generated pages may not validate or lint as html5
# If you don't have it install it via gem install rdiscount

# Makes pretty (descriptive) permalinks. See Jekyll docs for alternatives.

# Exclude metadata and development time dependencies (like Grunt plugins)
exclude: [README.md, package.json, grunt.js, Gruntfile.js, node_modules, gen.sh, Gemfile]
